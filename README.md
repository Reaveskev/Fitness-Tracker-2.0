# Fitness Tracker

Fitness Tracker is a full-stack app that allows the user to track their recorded workouts in a journal, record their recorded foods, generate a random motivational quote and see stastics on the home dashboard.
This is a recreation of my first complete React fullstack application. I decided to go back and improve upon it as well as add some new features.
